    bio:
      ai_interest: I'm also deeply fascinated by how AI and emerging technologies
        are transforming the way we work. I closely follow these developments and
        am passionate about exploring smarter ways to leverage them – both in everyday
        life and in our professional workflows.
      approach: I thrive in the role of driving progress, keeping things together,
        and creating clarity. But I'm equally passionate about listening, including
        others, and building trust. For me, a successful project isn't just about
        meeting deadlines – it's something we accomplish together, with purpose.
      intro: Hi! I'm Marcus and I work as a project manager with a passion for digital
        technologies, change management, and people. I love seeing ideas come to life
        – especially at the intersection of IT and business operations.
      outdoor: When I'm not working, you'll usually find me outdoors – I love being
        active, whether it's ski touring, climbing, mountain biking, or cross-country
        skiing. Nature gives me both energy and fresh perspectives, and that's where
        I recharge.
      website_purpose: That's something I hope to explore further here on this site
        – as a creative space where thoughts, projects, and curiosity can find their
        place.
    passion:
      bridge: As a project manager, I'm passionate about bridging the gap between
        technology and business operations. I'm driven by the desire to simplify complex
        solutions and make them accessible to everyone involved.

    quote: An experiment where <strong>AI becomes a creative partner</strong> in the
      development process - exploring new ways to create digital products.
    sections:
      goals_approach:
        approach: My hypothesis was that an iterative interplay between human and
          AI could shorten development time, improve code quality, and unleash creativity.
        goals: I wanted to build a modern, responsive, and aesthetically pleasing
          personal website from concept to production, while documenting the process,
          costs, and learnings to evaluate the return on investment.
        title: Project Goals & Approach
      lessons:
        list:
        - "<strong>Increased efficiency</strong> – Development time decreased with
          AI assistance"
        - "<strong>New skills</strong> – Developed novel approaches to working with
          AI"
        - "<strong>Human-machine balance</strong> – Human judgment remains critical"
        - "<strong>Rapid feedback loop</strong> – Switching between ChatGPT and Cursor
          created short idea-to-code cycles"
        - "<strong>AI ≠ autopilot</strong> – Human context and quality assurance are
          crucial"
        - "<strong>Scalable workflow</strong> – The structure resembles traditional
          project management; AI enhances rather than replaces"
        title: Key Lessons Learned
      overview_background:
        background1: In an era when AI tools are revolutionizing how we work, I wanted
          to explore how these tools can enhance the web development process. My goal
          was to create a personal website while exploring a new workflow where I
          act as an orchestrator between human creativity and AI capabilities.
        background2: I aimed to build a responsive, modern website with high quality,
          while gaining insights into AI-assisted development.
        content: This project represents an experiment in future ways of working,
          where I explore how AI tools can be integrated into the development process
          to build a personal website that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.
