  about:
    bio:
      ai_interest: I'm also deeply fascinated by how AI and emerging technologies
        are transforming the way we work. I closely follow these developments and
        am passionate about exploring smarter ways to leverage them – both in everyday
        life and in our professional workflows.
      approach: I thrive in the role of driving progress, keeping things together,
        and creating clarity. But I'm equally passionate about listening, including
        others, and building trust. For me, a successful project isn't just about
        meeting deadlines – it's something we accomplish together, with purpose.
      intro: Hi! I'm Marcus and I work as a project manager with a passion for digital
        technologies, change management, and people. I love seeing ideas come to life
        – especially at the intersection of IT and business operations.
      outdoor: When I'm not working, you'll usually find me outdoors – I love being
        active, whether it's ski touring, climbing, mountain biking, or cross-country
        skiing. Nature gives me both energy and fresh perspectives, and that's where
        I recharge.
      website_purpose: That's something I hope to explore further here on this site
        – as a creative space where thoughts, projects, and curiosity can find their
        place.
    passion:
      bridge: As a project manager, I'm passionate about bridging the gap between
        technology and business operations. I'm driven by the desire to simplify complex
        solutions and make them accessible to everyone involved.

    quote: What happens when AI evolves beyond just being a helper to become a true
      co-creator of digital products? That's what I set out to discover with Kyrk.org.
    sections:
      background_purpose:
        bold_statement: This project serves as a practical experiment in how AI-augmented
          work might evolve in the near future.
        conclusion: The results demonstrate that AI doesn't just save time – it can
          fundamentally transform our approach to thinking, organizing, and creating.
        content: |-
          <p>In recent years, AI has transformed from an academic research field into an everyday tool for professionals across industries – developers, designers, lawyers, editors, and many more. Tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and code assistants like Copilot and Cursor are revolutionizing our creative and development processes.</p>
          <p>However, this rapid evolution raises important questions for organizations and individuals:<br> <em>How can we integrate AI into our workflows while maintaining appropriate oversight?</em><br> <em>What happens to human creativity when algorithms become active collaborators?</em><br> <em>How do we balance AI capabilities with human judgment in development processes?</em></p>
          <p>This project offers a practical response to these questions. I wanted to explore firsthand how AI tools could help build a personal website from the ground up – not just using AI as a passive tool, but actively collaborating with it, orchestrating a blend of human creativity and computational efficiency.</p>
        title: Project Overview
      goals_approach:
        approach: 'My idea was simple: could collaboration between humans and AI make
          development faster and better? By letting AI support me in both planning
          and coding, I could test this in practice.'
        approach_title: Approach
        goals: I wanted to build a beautiful, user-friendly website from start to
          finish. At the same time, I wanted to track time, costs, and lessons learned
          to see if it was truly worth the effort.
        goals_title: Goals
        title: Goals & Approach
      lessons:
        list:
        - "<strong>Increased efficiency</strong> – Development time decreased with
          AI assistance"
        - "<strong>New skills</strong> – Developed novel approaches to working with
          AI"
        - "<strong>Human-machine balance</strong> – Human judgment remains critical"
        - "<strong>Rapid feedback loop</strong> – Switching between ChatGPT and Cursor
          created short idea-to-code cycles"
        - "<strong>AI ≠ autopilot</strong> – Human context and quality assurance are
          crucial"
        - "<strong>Scalable workflow</strong> – The structure resembles traditional
          project management; AI enhances rather than replaces"
        title: Key Lessons Learned
      results:
        brief_results:
        - 30 working hours total – from initial concept to launched website
        - 24/7 hosting at low cost via Render
        - "~$47/month total cost, including hosting, AI tools, and domain"
        - Better focus and flow thanks to clear role distribution between me and the
          AI
        - A workflow that is scalable and applicable to other projects
        commits:

        - "<strong>7</strong> May – 14 commits, 5 hours"
        intro: |-
          <p>This project didn't follow a straight line. Instead, it was a living process where ideas became plans, which became code, which was tested – and each step taught me something new. I was constantly jumping between thinking, creating, reflecting, and adjusting.</p>
          <p><strong>ChatGPT Plus</strong> was my thinking partner – someone to bounce ideas off, test reasoning, and structure thoughts. When I got stuck or needed to discuss different approaches, it functioned as a conversation partner.</p>
          <p><strong>Cursor with Claude 3.7</strong> was my practical helper. It delivered code directly in the editor, helped me break down tasks, and suggested terminal commands. A fast, precise, and responsive sidekick.</p>
          <p>The clever part of this setup was that each AI tool had its own role. Instead of one AI trying to do everything, I used specialized tools for different tasks. As the conductor between systems, I could steer direction and priorities, while creative solutions emerged from the interaction.</p>
          <p>The entire project took just <strong>30 hours</strong> from initial idea to launched site. But the most important result was the workflow itself – a model where AI and human together create something better than what we could accomplish separately.</p>
          <p>This is just the beginning of something bigger. Tomorrow's workplaces will likely look different, with more people working independently with support from various AI systems. We humans will still set the course, but the tools have become incredibly more powerful. This project doesn't just show what's possible today – but also how tomorrow's way of working might look.</p>
          <p>If one person can build all this in 30 hours with two AI tools, what could a small team achieve in just a week?</p>
        time_content: With the help of AI, I went from idea to finished website in
          just 30 hours.

            <p>In Samplanering.se, I led the work to implement a new digital tool that would improve communication and information exchange between Holmen and affected Sami villages – to streamline planning and create better conditions for consultation.</p>
            
            <div class="mt-6"></div>
            <p>The solution was developed in collaboration with an external system provider and included everything from data migration and functionality testing to training initiatives and implementation in operations.</p>
            
            <div class="mt-6"></div>
            <p>For those unfamiliar with the concept: <strong>samplanering</strong> (co-planning) is a structured form of dialogue between the forestry industry and reindeer husbandry, where parties jointly plan forestry measures in reindeer herding areas. The purpose is to create mutual understanding, facilitate consultation, and make more well-founded decisions.</p>
            
            <div class="mt-6"></div>
            <p>The project was conducted in close collaboration between business operations, IT, and external suppliers. We worked in an agile and goal-oriented manner, focusing on quality, user needs, and timeframes.</p>

            <p>The project resulted in a stable and functional platform that is used today in the daily co-planning work between Holmen and affected Sami villages. We achieved our goal – and most importantly, the tool is being used for real.</p>

            <div class="mt-6"></div>
            
            <p>One of the major benefits is that further development now happens jointly with other forestry companies and the system provider. This ensures that the user experience remains the same for reindeer husbandry regardless of who invites to consultation – something that both simplifies and lowers the threshold for digital participation.</p>

            - "The system was put into operation according to plan and is used today as a support for consultation processes"
