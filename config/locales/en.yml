    bio:
      ai_interest: I'm also deeply fascinated by how AI and emerging technologies
        are transforming the way we work. I closely follow these developments and
        am passionate about exploring smarter ways to leverage them – both in everyday
        life and in our professional workflows.
      approach: I thrive in the role of driving progress, keeping things together,
        and creating clarity. But I'm equally passionate about listening, including
        others, and building trust. For me, a successful project isn't just about
        meeting deadlines – it's something we accomplish together, with purpose.
      intro: Hi! I'm Marcus and I work as a project manager with a passion for digital
        technologies, change management, and people. I love seeing ideas come to life
        – especially at the intersection of IT and business operations.
      outdoor: When I'm not working, you'll usually find me outdoors – I love being
        active, whether it's ski touring, climbing, mountain biking, or cross-country
        skiing. Nature gives me both energy and fresh perspectives, and that's where
        I recharge.
      website_purpose: That's something I hope to explore further here on this site
        – as a creative space where thoughts, projects, and curiosity can find their
        place.
    passion:
      bridge: As a project manager, I'm passionate about bridging the gap between
        technology and business operations. I'm driven by the desire to simplify complex
        solutions and make them accessible to everyone involved.

      background_purpose:
        title: Project Overview
        content: "<p>In recent years, AI has transformed from an academic research field into an everyday tool for professionals across industries – developers, designers, lawyers, editors, and many more. Tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and code assistants like Copilot and Cursor are revolutionizing our creative and development processes.</p>

          <p>However, this rapid evolution raises important questions for organizations and individuals:<br>
          <em>How can we integrate AI into our workflows while maintaining appropriate oversight?</em><br>
          <em>What happens to human creativity when algorithms become active collaborators?</em><br>
          <em>How do we balance AI capabilities with human judgment in development processes?</em></p>

          <p>This project offers a practical response to these questions. I wanted to explore firsthand how AI tools could help build a personal website from the ground up – not just using AI as a passive tool, but actively collaborating with it, orchestrating a blend of human creativity and computational efficiency.</p>"
        
        bold_statement: "This project serves as a practical experiment in how AI-augmented work might evolve in the near future."
        conclusion: "The results demonstrate that AI doesn't just save time – it can fundamentally transform our approach to thinking, organizing, and creating."

        goals: "The goal was to build a modern, responsive, and aesthetically pleasing website – from concept to deployed product. At the same time, I wanted to document the process, costs, and key learnings to assess the return on investment."
        approach: "I wanted to test a hypothesis: that an iterative interplay between human and AI could shorten development time, improve code quality, and unleash creativity. By combining my own decisions with AI support in both planning and code generation, I was able to evaluate the effect of this interaction in practice."

          <p>Ruby on Rails was chosen for its rapid setup and solid structure for smaller projects. TailwindCSS provided design flexibility without having to manage heavy stylesheets. Git Bash was used for version control in a terminal-based workflow.</p>
          
          <p>On the AI side, Cursor with Claude 3.7 served as an executing assistant in the coding work, while ChatGPT Plus functioned as a sounding board and planning support throughout the process.</p>"

        title: Results & Reflection
        intro: "<p>This project wasn't characterized by a linear process but by a dynamic and educational workflow. Ideas evolved into plans, which became code, which was tested – and each iteration became a lesson in itself. It was a continuous shifting between thinking, creating, reflecting, and adjusting.</p>

        <p><strong>ChatGPT Plus</strong> served as a sounding board in the thinking phase – a place to ask questions, test reasoning, and structure thoughts. When something was unclear, such as a method's function or choice of approach, the model functioned as a discussion partner in planning and analysis.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Cursor with Claude 3.7</strong> took over in the execution stage. The tool delivered code directly in the editor, suggested how tasks could be broken down, and recommended commands in the terminal. As a technical assistant, it was fast, precise, and context-aware.</p>
        
        <p>What made the approach particularly powerful was the functionalization of AI tools. By using different models with clear roles – rather than relying on a single general solution – it became easier to maintain structure, overview, and momentum. The human served as a node between systems, and it was in the transitions between analysis, execution, and review that direction, prioritization, and creative responsibility took shape.</p>
        
        <p>The project was completed in a total of <strong>30 hours</strong>, from initial idea to finished and launched website. But the real result lay in the working method – a model for how AI tools and human judgment together can create something greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
        
        <p>This can be seen as a precursor to broader development. Working methods, professional roles, and workflows face potential transformation – where more people will work independently with support from multiple AI systems. Humans will continue to set the direction, but the tools at our disposal have become exponentially more powerful. This project points not only to what is possible today – but also to the direction we are moving toward tomorrow.</p>"
        
        time_content: By using an AI-driven workflow, I was able to keep the working time to just 30 hours total, from initial concept to launched website.
        brief_results:
